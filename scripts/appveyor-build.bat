REM assumes we're being run from top-level directory as:
REM scripts\appveyor-build.bat

@rem TODO: don't call when inappveyor env variable is set
@rem because Visual Studio is already in %PATH%
@rem also it seems that python is installed, so we could
@rem write build script in python
@rem alternatively, the script could be written in PowerShell
CALL scripts\vc.bat
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 EXIT /B 1

REM add our nasm.exe to the path
SET PATH=%CD%\bin;%PATH%

nmake -f makefile.msvc CFG=rel PLATFORM=X86 SumatraPDF Uninstaller

@rem TODO: build with more platforms, build and run tests etc.
